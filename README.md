# ScioSense ENS220 Arduino Library
Arduino library for the ENS220 high-accuracy barometric pressure and temperature sensor.

<img src="images/ens220.png" width="1000">

The ENS220 is an ultra-low-power, high-accuracy barometric pressure and temperature sensor produced by
[ScioSense](http://www.sciosense.com). It comes in the smallest size LGA package with digital I2C and SPI interfaces. 
This enables new use cases in activity tracking, indoor navigation/localization, fall- and liquid-level detection.

## Special Examples
This library includes two special examples:
* 05_Event_Detection: This algorithm allows you to detect when a door or window has been opened in your room.
* 06_Fall_Detection: This algorithm allows you to detect falls with the ENS220S only (no accelerometer required). More detailed documentation can be found [here](examples/06_Fall_Detection).

Both libraries demonstrate the amazing capabilities of the ENS220 to measure relative pressure with low noise and high data rate.
 
## Prerequisites
It is assumed that
 - The Arduino IDE has been installed.
   If not, refer to "Install the Arduino Desktop IDE" on the
   [Arduino site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
- The library directory is at its default location. Normally this is `C:\Users\[your_username]\Documents\Arduino\libraries`.

You might need to add your board to the Arduino IDE. This library was tested with the [Espressif ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32). 
For the installation of the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE, see [Arduino ESP32 Installation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)


## Installation

### Installation via Arduino Library Manager
- In the Arduino IDE, navigate to the Arduino Library Manager on the left side (or, alternatively, select Sketch > 
Include Library > Manage Libraries...)
- Search for `ScioSense_ENS220`
- Select the library from the search results and press `Install`

### Manual installation
- Download the code from this repository via "Download ZIP".
- In Arduino IDE, select Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP library... and browse to the just downloaded ZIP file.
- When the IDE is ready this README.md should be located at `C:\Users\[your_username]\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ScioSense_ENS220\README.md`.


## Wiring

### General
Please make sure that you use the correct supply voltage:
- The ENS220 runs at VDD = 1.8 V. If you are using the Sciosense ENS220 breakout board, you can use VDD = 3.3 V thanks
to the onboard LDO. 
- The I2C communication is 3.3 V tolerant.

### Example with ESP32 (I2C)
This example shows how to wire a [ESP32DevKitC](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html#get-started-esp32-devkitc-board-front) 
with the ENS220 breakout board for I2C communication.

### Interrupt functionality
To use the ENS220's interrupt functionality connect the interrupt pin of the ENS220 to a GPIO pin of your Arduino. The 
interrupt pin uses 1.8 V (logic level shifter might be required).


## Build an example
To build an example sketch
 - (Re)start Arduino.
 - Open File > Examples > Examples from Custom Libraries > ScioSense ENS220 > 01_Basic_I2C_SingleShot (or any other of the provided 
examples you wish to run)
 - Make sure Tools > Board lists the correct board.
 - Select Sketch > Verify/Compile.
